# Go-bot

## Current state

go-bot is the experiment that drives the developement of the `go-discord` library.
It currently handles some fun features :
* `!go played` : Gobot listen to each presence update and increment the playtime of users on its servers
* `!go reminder <time XhYmZs> [<message>]` : Set up a timer and simply ping the user after the specified time
* `!go twitch <game>` : Send the most watched twitch stream on the given game
